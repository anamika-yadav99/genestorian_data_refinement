# Biological concepts

A list of biological concepts important to understand the project.

## Added 27/05/2022

* DNA sequences, protein sequences (what are nucleotides and aminoacids)
* What are DNA, RNA, proteins and how sequences of DNA are replicated, transcribed and translated.
	* Transcription
	* mRNAs (messenger RNA)
	* Translation
	* tRNAs
	* Ribosomes, genetic code, start codon, stop codon, missense mutations, nonsense mutations, etc. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code). Don't really need to remember the names, just getting the point.
* What are genes, what are promoters
* What are oligonucleotides and plasmids
* What are resistance makers / selectable markers / auxotrophy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectable_marker#:~:text=Selectable%20markers%20are%20often%20antibiotic,resistance%20to%20an%20antibiotic.).
* Fluorescent proteins and protein tagging
* Yeast mating
* Some molecular cloning:
	* Restriction and ligation
	* PCR
	* Crispr
	* Homologous recombination and how it is used to edit genomes. This is still the most common way of doing it in pombe, so probably worth looking at the publications that explain the principles 
	https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0061(199807)14:10%3C943::AID-YEA292%3E3.0.CO;2-Y
	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3190138/ (this paper has a very nice figure)
	
* About S. pombe / fission yeast, the model organism that we cover in Pombase. A lot of what you learn in here would be useful for other yeasts as well. A good place to start is this website: https://dornsife.usc.edu/pombenet/ Check the 'About Pombe' and 'working with pombe' sections. They cover the basics of how strains are generated. A very important thing to realise is that pombe is typically haploid, but sometimes diploid. A lot of eukaryotes (including ourselves) are diploid (have two copies of each gene), but most yeast strains are not like that.


Other things for the future (don't look at them yet):
* Leu2 plasmid in pombe (very specific to pombe)
